#  <h1>Assignment 4- Combining feature cleaning,h20 test running to find best model for dataset and later on model interpretability and shap testing</h1>

# <h2>About the Dataset</h2>
# 
# The dataset provided is a fictional dataset created by IBM data scientists to simulate employee attrition. It encompasses various factors and attributes associated with employees, ranging from demographic information to job-related aspects. This dataset is designed for data science and analytical purposes to explore the underlying factors contributing to employee attrition within a hypothetical organization
# 
# 
# <h2>Abstract</h2>
# 
# The dataset aims to shed light on the intricate dynamics of employee attrition, offering a comprehensive set of features that capture different facets of an employee's professional and personal life. It includes variables such as education level, environmental satisfaction, job involvement, job satisfaction, performance rating, relationship satisfaction, and work-life balance.
# 
# The educational background of employees is categorized into five levels: 'Below College,' 'College,' 'Bachelor,' 'Master,' and 'Doctor.' Various aspects of job satisfaction, such as environmental satisfaction, job involvement, job satisfaction, performance rating, relationship satisfaction, and work-life balance, are quantified on different scales.
# 
# The dataset presents an opportunity to investigate correlations and patterns within these attributes and their impact on employee attrition. It encourages exploratory data analysis and the application of machine learning models to predict and understand the likelihood of attrition based on the provided features.
# 
# Researchers and data scientists can leverage this dataset to address specific questions related to attrition, such as examining the breakdown of distance from home by job role and attrition, or comparing average monthly income based on education and attrition status. The simulated nature of the data allows for a controlled environment for experimentation and analysis, providing valuable insights that can be applied to real-world scenarios in talent management and employee retention strategies.

# Generalized Linear Model (GLM) is a type of statistical model that extends the concept of linear regression to a broader class of models, allowing for more flexibility in modeling different types of data. GLMs were introduced by Nelder and Wedderburn in 1972.
# 
# Here are some key characteristics and concepts related to GLMs:
# 
# Linear Relationship: Like linear regression, GLMs assume that there is a linear relationship between the predictor variables (independent variables) and the response variable (dependent variable). However, this linearity assumption is applied to a transformed function of the expected response, not the response itself.
# 
# Generalized Linear Model Components: A GLM consists of three main components:
# 
# Random Component (Distribution Family): This component describes the probability distribution of the response variable, which can be any distribution from the exponential family (e.g., Gaussian, Poisson, Binomial, Gamma). The choice of distribution family depends on the nature of the response variable.
# 
# Systematic Component (Linear Predictor): The linear predictor is a linear combination of the predictor variables, with coefficients to be estimated. It's usually denoted as Œ∑ (eta). The link function connects the expected response to the linear predictor.
# 
# Link Function: The link function relates the expected value of the response variable to the linear predictor. It transforms the linear predictor to the appropriate scale for the response variable. Common link functions include the identity, logit, log, and inverse functions. Fitting the Model: GLMs are typically fit to the data using the method of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to estimate the model parameters (coefficients) that best describe the relationship between the predictors and the response.
# 
# Applications: GLMs are versatile and can be used for a wide range of applications, including linear regression (Gaussian distribution), logistic regression (Binomial distribution), Poisson regression (Poisson distribution), and gamma regression (Gamma distribution), among others. They are well-suited for regression analysis and classification problems.
# 
# Model Interpretability: GLMs offer interpretable coefficients that describe the strength and direction of the relationships between predictor variables and the response. The interpretation depends on the choice of the distribution family and the link function. Assumptions: While GLMs relax some of the assumptions of classical linear regression, they still have their own set of assumptions, such as the correct choice of the distribution family and the appropriate link function. Violations of these assumptions can affect the model's accuracy. Extensions: Generalized Linear Models have been extended to include Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs), which further expand their capabilities for modeling complex relationships in data.

# # In this part of the code, I am building a simple Generalized Linear Model (GLM) using H2O. Let's break down what this code does:
# 
# a)data_glm = H2OGeneralizedLinearEstimator(family="gaussian", standardize=True): I create an instance of the H2OGeneralizedLinearEstimator class, which is used to build generalized linear models. I specify the model parameters:
# 
# b)family="gaussian": This parameter specifies the distribution family for the GLM. In this case, I am using a Gaussian distribution, which is appropriate for regression tasks where the response variable is continuous and normally distributed.
# 
# c)standardize=True: This parameter indicates that the predictor variables should be standardized before fitting the model. Standardization involves scaling the variables to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It can help improve model convergence and interpretability.
# 
# d)data_glm.train(x=myX, y=myY, training_frame=train, validation_frame=test): You train the GLM model using the train method of the data_glm object. Here's what each argument does: x=myX: This specifies the predictor variables you defined earlier, which will be used to make predictions. y=myY: This specifies the response variable, which is the variable you want to predict. training_frame=train: You use the train dataset as the training data for building the model. The train dataset is typically larger and used to train the model.
# 
# e)validation_frame=test: You use the test dataset for validation, which helps assess the model's performance on data it hasn't seen during training. This can be used to evaluate the model's generalization ability.

# ## Questions and their answers-
# 
# 1. What is the question?
# 
# Answer: The question was to analyze our employee attrition dataset and identify the most influential predictors of employee attrition. We found that variables such as 'JobSatisfaction', 'YearsAtCompany', and 'MonthlyIncome' were strong predictors of attrition, while less important features like 'Education' and 'Gender' were dropped. After feature selection, we applied outlier detection and data loss techniques to assess the impact on model performance, which showed a significant change in the confusion matrix. Further, we performed AutoML to identify the best algorithm/model for our dataset, where Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) was selected. Compared to a previous assignment where we achieved 77% accuracy on an unprocessed dataset, we observed a 10% accuracy improvement (up to 87%) after combining models.
# 
# Fit a linear model and interpret the regression coefficients:
# 
# Answer: When 'JobSatisfaction' increases by one unit, the odds of employee attrition increase by more than 1x (specific coefficient value) compared to the odds of no attrition. In contrast, as 'Education' level rises by one unit, the effect on attrition odds is relatively minimal (specific coefficient value).
# 
# Fit a tree-based model and interpret the nodes:
# 
# Answer: The tree-based model (e.g., Decision Tree or Random Forest) reveals the hierarchical split points that led to predictions of employee attrition. For instance, the root node might be 'YearsAtCompany', indicating its significance in the model's decision-making process. By interpreting nodes in the tree, we understand how different features contribute to attrition predictions.
# 
# Use AutoML to find the best model:
# 
# Answer: Through AutoML, we determined that deeplearning is the most effective model for predicting employee attrition in our dataset. Key features such as 'JobSatisfaction' and 'YearsAtCompany' were identified as highly influential in the deeplearning model, while less important features like 'Education' had minimal impact.
# 
# Run SHAP analysis on the models from steps 1, 2, and 3, interpret the SHAP values, and compare them with other model interpretability methods:
# 
# Answer: After running SHAP analysis:
# For the linear model, 'YearsAtCompany' emerged as the top feature impacting attrition predictions, with higher values indicating lower attrition odds. 'Education' had a lesser impact.
# In tree-based models, 'YearsAtCompany' and 'JobSatisfaction' were highlighted as significant features affecting attrition predictions. SHAP values showed how these features influenced model output.
